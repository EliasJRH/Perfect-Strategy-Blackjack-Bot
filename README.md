# Perfect-Strategy-Blackjack-Bot
My final project for COMP 1405 @ Carleton University. I created a bot that uses both the Hi-Lo method of card counting and the perfect strategy table in an attempt to win as much money as possible. I then compared using both strategies to see how they stack up against the use of each individual strategy on it's own as well as the use of no strategy to see how well it would compare.
